<p>Sample Test Script</p>
<p>Hi, _______. My name is _____, and I'm going to be
  walking you through this session.
  You probably already know, but let me explain why we've
  asked you to come here today: As part of a class, we're testing a web site that
  we're working on to see what it's like for actual people to
  use it.
  I want to make it clear right away that we're testing the
  site
  , not you. You can't do anything wrong here, so you don't have
  to worry about making mistakes.
  We want to hear exactly what you think, so please don't
  worry that you're going to hurt our feelings.  We want to
  improve it, so we need to know honestly what you think.  </p>
<p>As we go along, I'm going to ask you to think out loud, to
  tell me what's going through your mind. This will help us.
  If you have questions, just ask. I may not be able to answer
  them right away, since we're interested in how people do
  when they don't have someone sitting next to them, but I will
  try to answer any questions you still have when we're done.</p>
<p>We'd also like to video this session an put it on youtube, but you won't be identified as part of the assignment. The recording
  will be used only to help us figure out how to improve the
  site, and it won't be seen by anyone except the people
working on the project. </p>
<p> Do you have any questions before we begin?</p>
<p> First, I'm just going to ask you to look at this page and tell
  me what you think it is, what strikes you about it, and what
  you think you would click on first.
  And again, as much as possible, it will help us if you can try
  to think out loud so we know what you're thinking about.</p>
